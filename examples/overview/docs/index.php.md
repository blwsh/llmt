# Documentation for PHP File

## Overview
This PHP file is responsible for authorizing a user and then greeting them. It utilizes an external autoloaded library to initialize an `Authorizer` instance for user authorization and a `Greeter` instance to generate a greeting message.

## Logic
- Include the Composer autoload file to load external dependencies.
- Use the `Authorizer` class to create a new instance for a user with the username 'ben'.
- Check if the user is authorized by calling the `authorize` method.
  - If the user is not authorized, the script terminates, displaying a message "You are authorized!".
- Create a new instance of the `Greeter` class.
- Output a greeting message by calling the `greet` method of the `Greeter` instance.`Gereeter` class to display a greeting message.
