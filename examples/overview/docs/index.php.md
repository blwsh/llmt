# Documentation for PHP File

## Overview
This PHP file is responsible for authorizing a user and then greeting them. It utilizes the `Authorizer` class for user authorization and the `Gereeter` class to generate a greeting message.

## Logic
- Includes necessary dependencies through Composer's autoload feature.
- Instantiates an `Authorizer` object with a username ('ben').
- Checks if the user is authorized using the `authorize` method.
- If the authorization fails, the script terminates with a message indicating the user is authorized.
- Creates an instance of the `Gereeter` class.
- Calls the `greet` method of the `Gereeter` instance and outputs the greeting message.f the `Gereeter` class.
