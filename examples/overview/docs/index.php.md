# PHP File Documentation

## Overview
This PHP file is responsible for handling user authorization and greeting functionality. It utilizes the `Authorizer` class to check if the user is authorized and the `Gereeter` class to generate a greeting message.

## Logic
- Includes the Composer autoload file to utilize external packages.
- Uses the `Authorizer` class from the `BenWatson\MyPhpProject\auth` namespace for user authorization.
- Instantiates the `Authorizer` with the username 'ben'.
- Checks if the user 'ben' is authorized:
  - If not authorized, the script terminates and displays "You are authorized!".
- If authorized, instantiates the `Gereeter` class.
- Outputs a greeting message using the `greet()` method from the `Gereeter` class.e.`Gereeter` class to display a greeting message.
