# PHP File Documentation

## Overview
This PHP file implements a simple authorization and greeting functionality. It utilizes an `Authorizer` class to check if a user is authorized and, upon successful authorization, uses a `Greeter` class to provide a greeting message.

## Logic
- Load required classes via Composer's autoload.
- Instantiate the `Authorizer` class with the username 'ben'.
- Check if the user 'ben' is authorized using the `authorize` method.
  - If the user is not authorized, output a message and terminate execution.
- Instantiate the `Greeter` class.
- Call the `greet` method of the `Greeter` class and display the greeting message.greet()` method to display a greeting message.`greet()` method from the `Gereeter` class.
